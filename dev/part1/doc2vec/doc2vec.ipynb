      "A teacher is explaining to her class how different languages use  negatives differently.  She says, \"In all languages, a positive followed by a negative or a negative followed by a positive makes a negative.  In some languages, two negatives together make a positive, while in others they make a negative.  But in no language do two positives make a negative.\"    One of the students puts up his hand and says,  \"Yeah, right.\"  \n",
